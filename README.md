# Project 5

Author: Jeff Quittman Project: P#5 - Work Day Scheduler

Date: May 2020

## Description:

Fifth project for the UCLA/Trilogy Full Stack Boot Camp that tasks the student with building a reactive work schedule application that is dynamic and changes depending on what time it is. Time is indicated by Moment.JS and in this schedule, it uses the hour method on Moment.JS to determine if we are
in a specific hour block, or before/after that block. The time indication will either allow the user to store new events in the time block if the time block is in the future. Or not allow editing if the time block is in the present or past. In addition, the save button will change to a lock button
if the event is in the present or past as you cannot edit or save any changes for events that are taking place or have taken place. All updated time blocks are saved to the local storage to ensure that they remain on the schedule when the user returns from the same workstation.

The DOM elements are made with reactive bootstrap classes to ensure that the schedule keeps its UI even if used on a smaller resolution screen such as a mobile device.
