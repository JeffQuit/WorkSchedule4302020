# Project 5

Author: Jeff Quittman Project: P#5 - Work Day Scheduler

Date: April 2020

## Description:

Fifth project for the UCLA/Trilogy Full Stack Boot Camp that tasks the student with building a quiz application in Javascript. The quiz is initiated by a start button which then starts a countdown
clock of 100 seconds. The quiz taker has 100 seconds to complete the quiz or it takes them to the submit score page to submit their current score. The score starts at 0 and each correct question is
worth 10 points. On the other hand, any incorrect answer deducts 10 seconds from the time left. When the quiz is completed by all questions being answered or the time running out, the user will have
to submit their name and the score they received to a leaderboard. At the leaderboard page, they can decided to clear the high scores or re-take the quiz. At anytime, the user can check the
leaderboard by clicking the leaderboard button in the top-right hand side of the page.

The HTML is mostly made in bootstrap with some additional CSS styles on the style.css page included.
